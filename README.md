# Weekly Planner Web Application
A weekly planner web application that allows users to create and update their own personal to-do lists. The frontend was created with React and the global state was handled with Redux. React was chosen due to the various reusable components present in the weekly planner, allowing for a sleek web application to be made. The backend was implemented using Express, RestAPIs, and MongoDB that allows users to login/register accounts in addition to saving lists across sessions.
